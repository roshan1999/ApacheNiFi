## FlowFile conversion for big data analytics using APACHE NIFI.
> Configuration files and details are given in MYSQLTOORACLEreport.pdf

- Apache NIFI is a web interface tool that provides the transfer of huge sophisticated files from a server to another server or client without the need to store locally.
- During the transfer, it supports multiple conversion features such as the one done in this project.
- The motivation for this project came from my internship where the company had a database to be transferred from one end of the server to another while inserting and updating certain columns along with converting the database to support ORACLE commands while converting it from MYSQL commands.
